This layer is the most noticeable one since it is the layer that touches your skin. The second layer contains a super absorbent material to hold your flow. The third layer is made of leak-proof material to prevent any leakage, while the fourth layer is made of cotton fabric to ensure maximum comfort and breathability for a full day of wear. </p>"

The first layer is made of antibacterial breathable fabric that helps control odour and draws moisture quickly for a dryer feel. This layer is the most noticeable one since it is the layer that touches your skin. The second layer contains a super absorbent material to hold your flow. The third layer is made of leak-proof material to prevent any leakage, while the fourth layer is made of cotton fabric to ensure maximum comfort and breathability for a full day of wear. </p>"
